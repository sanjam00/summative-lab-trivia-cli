The purpose of this project is to create a simple trivia game played in the CLI.

For user interface and functionality, programs like chalk and inquirer were used to add style and arrow key functions, while making the game easier to navigate.
The summative lab uses multiple methods and functionalities learned throughout this stin- such as modules, object and array iteration, and asynchronous functions.
